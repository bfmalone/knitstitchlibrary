## Casting on
Once you have your pattern, yarn, and needle selected the next thing to do is to begin your project by casting on. Casting on is the process of creating new stitches by basically looping your desired number of stitches onto a needle. There are multiple different ways to cast on, and each of these methods has a different benefit for the project and person using it. 

Some cast-on examples are:<br>
Longtail cast-on: By far the most common cast-on, Longtail is great because it is easy, fast, and somewhat stretchy. You can use this on practically any project but itâ€™s great for hats, scarves, and sweaters.<br> 
Norwegian cast-on: Also known as the twisted German cast-on is very similar to the longtail cast-on but is significantly more elastic. It is most often used for socks, mittens, hats, and other projects that need a bit more stretch.<br> 
Tubular cast-on: Most commonly used for hats and socks to create a stretchy edge that looks a bit rolled over. It is perfect to use on projects with ribbing, as it sort of resembles it.<br> 
Provisional cast-on: A provisional cast-on is interesting because it is temporary. If you want to use a different edging or need to do something specific for a pattern you just can rip it out while still having usable stitches. Most often this cast-on is used to create the underarms on sweaters.<br> 
Turkish cast-on: This cast-on is best used on projects where you want a practically invisible starting edge. Because of this, it is often used on toe-up socks to hide the seam. 

After you're done casting on your desired number of stitches, you can just start knitting! 

## Casting off
After finishing what you're working on, the way to truly complete the project is to cast or bind off. Binding off is essentially the opposite of casting on, because you create an edge to your work. In this case it marks the end of the work rather than the start. The type of bind off you choose can be very important, as some projects require stretchier bind-offs.
