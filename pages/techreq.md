## Collection Items
The items in this collection were chosen, hand-knit, and photographed by the creator of this collection. Because of this, all of the sample photographs shown are owned by the creator, but the stitches are public domain. and the stitches are public domain. All items in this collection have undergone slight enhancements, which are noted below. 

## Imaging Standards
These swatches were photographed using an iPhone on a flat background in natural lighting. The photos were then uploaded to a laptop, cropped to best show the pattern, and slightly edited to enhance color and display.  

## Metadata Standards
The metadata for this project was deliberately chosen and added to make this site very user-friendly and informative. Each item entry has various fields that have helpful or interesting information for the user. As a result of knitting stitches being a very detailed topic, the collection uses Dublin Core and original elements to best describe the content. The vocabularies used are also established, such as Library of Congress Subject Headings, as well as custom subject headings.
