## About the Collection
The knit stitch library is a resource for everyone interested in knitting, whether they are just starting out or are more advanced and looking for inspiration. All stitches shown have detailed instructions, pattern abbreviations, difficulty ratings, ways to use this stitch, as well as information about the origin of the stitch if known. 

Each example was hand-knit by the creator of this collection, and specifics of the samples made are included under each entry. 

I hope you enjoy using this resource!
