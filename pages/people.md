##About the Creator

Brandis Malone is a first year graduate student in the dual Russian and Eastern European and library science program specializing in archives and records management. She currently works at the Lilly Library as a desk attendant and technical services assitant, as well as a records management assistant at Indiana University's Archives. In her freetime all she does is knit to an unhealthy degree, and cry over her digital libraries assignment.

She began knitting almost 5 years ago, when her aunt taught her how to knit. Since then knitting has become one of her favorite hobbies. Brandis has taught many of her friends how to knit, and she loves to teach people the craft when she can. Some of her favorite things to knit are socks, mittens, and shawls.
