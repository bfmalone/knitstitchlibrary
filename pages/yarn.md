## Yarn
Yarn is by far the most important aspect of any knitting project! You can find yarn in a variety of different sizes, colors, types, and lengths to suit any project you’re working on. For many people looking for yarn can be a really fun part of their project. It can be as simple as picking a pattern, figuring out how much yarn you need, and wandering down to your local craft store to purchase some in your favorite color. You can also visit a special yarn store for a more curated selection or you can even go online to look for exactly what you want and get it shipped at your convenience. 

## Yarn Weight
Oftentimes patterns will have a recommended yarn that the creator used, and that information will also have the yarn weight and yardage required for the project. Yarn weight refers to the thickness of yarn, and it ranges from incredibly thin (lace) to very thick (jumbo). The weight you’ll need will vary from project to project. For example, socks are normally made with fingering weight yarn, sweaters with aran or worsted yarn, and blankets with bulky yarn. 

You can easily identify the weight of a skein of yarn by the packaging, as it should list the weight by either numbers or terms. Another important thing to look out for when buying yarn is the yardage you’ll need. Skeins of yarn can range from about 120 all the way up to 480, but it depends on the yarn's weight, quality, and price. 

## Yarn Material
Another important thing to consider when purchasing or using yarn is the material it’s made out of. This can affect how it feels to knit with and wear, as well as how to properly take care of your finished product.
