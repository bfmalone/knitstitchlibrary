## Yarn
Yarn is by far the most important aspect of any knitting project! You can find yarn in a variety of different sizes, colors, types, and lengths to suit any project you’re working on. For many people looking for yarn can be a really fun part of their project. It can be as simple as picking a pattern, figuring out how much yarn you need, and wandering down to your local craft store to purchase some in your favorite color. You can also visit a special yarn store for a more curated selection or you can even go online to look for exactly what you want and get it shipped at your convenience. 

## Yarn Weight
Oftentimes patterns will have a recommended yarn that the creator used, and that information will also have the yarn weight and yardage required for the project. Yarn weight refers to the thickness of yarn, and it ranges from incredibly thin (lace) to very thick (jumbo). The weight you’ll need will vary from project to project. For example, socks are normally made with fingering weight yarn, sweaters with aran or worsted yarn, and blankets with bulky yarn.

You can easily identify the weight of a skein of yarn by the packaging, as it should list the weight by either numbers or terms. Another important thing to look out for when buying yarn is the yardage you’ll need. Skeins of yarn can range from about 120 all the way up to 480, but it depends on the yarn's weight, quality, and price. 

## Yarn Material
Another important thing to consider when purchasing or using yarn is the material it’s made out of. This can affect how it feels to knit with and wear, as well as how to properly take care of your finished product. Yarn can be made out of various materials, and the main categories are animal fibers, natural fibers, and synthetic fibers. 

Animal fibers are things like wool, whether it be from a sheep, camel, alpaca, or even your dog if that’s what you're into. Animal fibers like this can be incredibly warm, breathable, and stretchy, making them an excellent choice for any project. It is worth noting that wool yarn can be soft, like merino wool, or very itchy, so make sure you pay attention to the yarn you’re selecting if you choose to knit with animal fibers. 

Yarn with natural fibers can be made out of cotton, bamboo, hemp, linen, etc. Basically anything that’s not animal or synthetic. Natural fibers are amazing if you’re allergic to animal fibers, and they are super soft and breathable. Fibers like bamboo also have great drape, which makes them a good choice for projects like shawls. Cotton is another fine choice for projects around the house, such as dishtowels, but it’s important to note that cotton fibers can stretch quite a lot if you get them wet. 

And finally, synthetic fibers are another massive category of yarn available. Oftentimes this will be the cheapest option, and you will probably be able to find acrylic yarn of all weights and colors at just about any craft store you go to. Like animal and natural fibers, acrylic yarn can be very warm and soft. It is also really durable and some brands can withstand being run through a washing machine, unlike wool or cotton.
