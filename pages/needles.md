## Needles
Knitting is done with two needles, and the type and material of your needles are very important relates to your project and yarn. There are also several different ways to knit with your needles, and that method depends on what is most comfortable to the knitter. 


## Needle Sizes
Needles are measured in a variety of different ways. Universally, milimeter measurements of the diameter of needles is the standard, but there are also regional differences. The United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan all have their own measurement systems, and you can find conversion charts online. 
In US measurements, needles range from US size 0 all the way up to 50. Oftentimes on needles you buy in the States you’ll see the US measurement along with the diameter. The needle size you’ll need depends on the type of yarn you’re doing to be using. So smaller needles will be used for things like socks and mittens that use thin yarn, and larger needles can be used for big projects such as blankets and sweaters. 


## Needle Types
When beginning a project one of the important things to consider is the type of needle you plan to use for your project. Generally speaking, there are three types of needles: straight needles, double pointed needles (DPNs), and circular needles.

    <dt>Straight Needles<dt>
<dd>If you’ve ever thought about knitting these are probably the needles you imagined. Straight needles are long pointed needles with a cap on one end to stop yarn from slipping off. Because these needles are single-pointed and have an end these are best for flat knitting projects like scarves, dishtowels, and projects that can be pieced together.<dd> 
<dt>Double Pointed Needles<dt>
<dd>Similar to straight needles but not quite are double pointed needles. Generally they are pretty short, and have two points instead of just one. Because you can knit on both side of these needles they are used for knitting in the round. While working with these you knit on two needles, but switch between them, making a circle. These are perfect for projects like mittens, socks, hats, and arms. They can be pretty tricky to get used to but once you’ve gotten the hang of it they can be a very efficient, neat way to work.<dd>
<dt>Circular Needles<dt>
<dd>And finally the last type of knitting needles are circular needles. Essentially these are two straight/DPN needles attached by a cord. Often these cords can be changed out and vary in length so you can use them for basically any project, flat or round. Knitting with these in the round is the preferred method for many people, and it’s referred to as the Magic Loop Method.  You can use these needles for things large things like sweaters, blankets, shawls, or smaller projects like hats and socks.<dd>

## Needle Material
Another important thing to consider with needles is the materials that they’re made of. Knitting needles can be made out of wood and metal, and there are different benefits to each.

    <dt>Wooden Knitting Needles</dt>
    <dd>Wooden needles are excellent for small projects and beginner projects, because they have some grip. Compared to metal needles that are a bit slippery, stitches are less likely to slide off needles, making them nice to work with. One thing to note is that it can be a bit slow to knit with these due to their grippinesss..</dd>
    <dt>Metal Knitting Needles</dt>
    <dd>These needles can be made out of a variety of different types of metal, such as brass, nickel, and or steel. Metal needles are really great if you want to knit quickly, as the metal helps the stitches slide off the needle easily. Because they’re slick, it isn’t recommended for beginners to start off with them, and they can be tricky to work with if you’re not prepared.</dd>
